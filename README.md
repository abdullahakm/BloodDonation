# 🩸 Blood Donation API

This is a backend API for a Blood Donation Management System developed using **ASP.NET Core Web API** and following the principles of **Clean Architecture**. The purpose of this system is to streamline the process of blood donation, blood requests, and hospital API integrations in a secure, modular, and scalable way.

## ✅ Project Overview

The Blood Donation API enables users to:
- Register via mobile or web platforms.
- Donate or request blood.
- Automatically manage user roles based on actions.
- Provide controlled API access to hospitals or organizations after registration and payment.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project is structured using **Clean Architecture** which separates concerns across layers:

- **Core** – Domain entities and enums.
- **Application** – Interfaces and business logic.
- **Infrastructure** – Data access and persistence logic.
- **Presentation** – The API entry point (currently under development).

## 🧪 Technology Stack

- **.NET 9 / ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **Clean Architecture**
- **C#**
- **SQL Server** (planned)

## 🧬 Entities & Enums

### Enums:
- `BloodGroup` – (A+, A−, B+, B−, AB+, AB−, O+, O−)
- `Province` – (Punjab, Sindh, KhyberPakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, GilgitBaltistan)
- `Role` – (SystemAdmin, SystemUser, SimpleUser, ClientUser)
- `TestType` – (HBsAg, HIV, VDRL, AntiHCV, BloodCellCount)

> You can find these in `Core/Enums/`.

---

## 🔁 User Flow

1. **Registration**:
   - User registers via app.
   - Assigned `SimpleUser` role by default.

2. **Home Page Options**:
   - **Donate Blood**: Marks `IsDonor = true` in `BloodBank` entity.
   - **Request Blood**: Marks `IsRequestee = true`.

3. **Admin Functionalities**:
   - One primary admin manages the system.
   - Admin can:
     - Create new `SystemUser`s.
     - Approve hospital integrations.

4. **Hospital Integration**:
   - Hospital registers in the system.
   - Upon payment, a `ClientUser` is created with limited endpoint access.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Full **user authentication and authorization**
- JWT token support and role-based access control
- Admin dashboard (web)
- Integration with payment gateway
- Email/SMS notification system
- Hospital analytics dashboard
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Deployment to cloud (Azure/AWS)
